An easy way to keep track of the apple positions in Huang's apple game from Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town that should also work for the original Harvest Moon version of the game.


How to use this app:

There are 7 possible move sequences for Huang's apple game, each corresponding to a specific rearrangement of the apples. In order to identify which sequence is being used, you can focus solely on where the left apple is moving each time it moves.


The 3 different apples are the following: Hyper Miracle Sweet Gorgeous Beautiful (HMSWGB or H for short), Super Ultra Great Delicious Wonderful (SUGDW or S for short), and Angel Eternal Pure Fresh Elegant (AEPFE or A for short). The initial arrangement will always be SHA at the start of the game.


This app will keep track of the apple arrangement and update it after each sequence so that you can win the game with minimal manual effort. All you need to do is indicate which sequence occurred after each round.


The sequence options are as follows:

C--L - left apple moves to center, stays still next 2 steps, then moves to left 

R--C - left apple moves to right, stays still next 2 steps, then moves to center

RL - left apple moves to right, then to left

CRL-(C) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to left, then stays still, eventually lands at center

CRC-(L) - left apple moves to center, then right, then to center, then stays still, eventually lands at left

CRC...(L) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to center, eventually lands at left

CRC...(R) - left apple moves to center, then to right, then to center, eventually lands at right


Per the original guide, you only need to take note of the left apple's position after its first 2 movements; however, if its first 2 movements land it in the center position and then the right position, you must follow it to the end and take note of its final position. I have created the keys with this strategy in mind, but I have also noted early exit conditions for applicable sequences for the convenience of users who feel comfortable incorporating them into their strategy.
